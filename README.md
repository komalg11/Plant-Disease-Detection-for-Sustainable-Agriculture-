ðŸš€ A machine learning web app that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a TFLite model and Streamlit â€” hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

---

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works
- Upload a photo of a leaf ðŸŒ±
- The app uses a TensorFlow Lite model to classify it into one of **38 plant disease categories**
- Built with:
  - TensorFlow Lite for inference
  - OpenCV for image preprocessing
  - Streamlit for UI
  - Docker for containerization
  - Hugging Face Spaces for deployment

---

## ðŸ“· Supported Plant Classes

Examples include:
- Apple Scab
- Tomato Late Blight
- Grape Leaf Blight
- Orange Citrus Greening
- Potato Early Blight
- ...and many more!
